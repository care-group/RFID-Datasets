# RFID Datasets

This repository contains the RFID dataset detailed in our paper 'A COTS (UHF) RFID Floor for Device-Free Ambient Assisted Living Monitoring'. Also provided is the associated smart home data (exported from OpenHAB), that we did not discuss in the paper, but may be of interest as supplementary data or as the training data for activity/localisation classification in its own right.

Files from both sources are provided in CSV and ARFF format. The data is presented linearly over time, from Participant 1 - Participant 6. Activity, location, participant ID, and Unix timestamp are provided for each entry.
